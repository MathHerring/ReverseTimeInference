# ReverseTimeInference
This repository demonstrates inference in target state aligned ensembles for the example of cytokinetic ring constriction. Please cite our corresponding publication 

"Reverse Time Analysis of Target-State Directed Processes in Living Systems" - https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03226

- inference subsampling: TSAEnsembleVsPathInference.ipynb
- code to generate an ensemble of SDEs with power law force
- code to generate the cytokinesis ensemble
